This is our repository containing our refining COVID-19 data. 
In this repository you will find python scripts that will be using pandas data frames and series to graph public COVID data from the CDC. The states we have used are Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The python scripts in the repository will create a continous line graph, bar chart and a scatter plot.
